       I’m a frontend developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, interactive, and visually pleasing web interfaces.

I focus on writing structured HTML, scalable CSS, and JavaScript that enhances user experience without overcomplicating things.

I love working on UI-focused projects, experimenting with layouts, hover effects, and smooth interactions.

Currently, I’m strengthening my skills in React and building real-world projects to grow as a developer.
